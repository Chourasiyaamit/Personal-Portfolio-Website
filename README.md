# Personal-Portfolio-Website
This is my personal portfolio website, created with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It showcases responsive projects, coding samples, and front-end skills, and includes a contact form (Formspree) for direct messages. Designed for clarity and accessibility across desktop and mobile devices.
